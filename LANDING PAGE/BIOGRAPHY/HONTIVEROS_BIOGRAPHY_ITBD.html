                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My childhood was  full of fun and adventure.<sup>1</sup>  Every summer we go to the province to visit other family members.<sup>2</sup> It was full of innocence and not a single bit of worry about my surroundings.<sup>3</sup> 
                Spending summer vacation with my cousins was fun because we spend all our time playing around. <sup>4</sup> We go to the playground and climb trees.<sup>5</sup>  Sometimes we go to the Mall to play and do crazy things.<sup>6</sup> 
                We also go to the pool to swim and cool down while it is summer.<sup>7</sup> My mother would also bring me to different places like zoos, parks, and beaches.<sup>8</sup> 
                I once attended a costume party while dressed as Batgirl, although I was the only one wearing a costume.<sup>9</sup> It was a little embarasing because the other kids are wearing normal clothes.<sup>10</sup> I also watch morning and afternoon cartoons.<sup>11</sup> 
                Whenever I go outside to play with my friends, one of them will scream “DORAEMON NA!” then we will all go home to watch cartoons.<sup>12</sup> I got most of the cartoons theme song memorized,I would sing them non-stop.<sup>13</sup>
                I spent most of my childhood years outside, Playing hopscotch,hide-n-seek, and sometime we play langit-lupa.<sup>14</sup> Sometimes, I get wounded from playing and go home crying.<sup>15</sup> 
                One time I pretended to be wonder woman and jumped from the stairs.<sup>16</sup> My chin got injured which left a mark on me, but it was worth it.<sup>17</sup>
                I wish I could go back to the good old times.<sup>18</sup> I wish I can still spend my time not worrying about the world.<sup>19</sup> 
                Being a child is really fun when you are full of innocence and curiosity.<sup>20</sup></p>

            <br>
            <div class="textbox">
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my teenage years, I was a slacker.<sup>1</sup> I was not taking my life seriously.<sup>2</sup>
                I have not decided about my career yet or what I want to do with my life.<sup>3</sup>
                After school I would go home immediately to play games.<sup>4</sup> Sometime, I would skip some classes just so I can play games.<sup>5</sup> 
                I had too much confidence in myself for the reason that I would get high marks in quizzes and tests without studying.<sup>6</sup> 
                i did not participate in events or activities.<sup>7</sup> Instead, I would go look for a quiet place to hang out by myself and enjoy my time.<sup>8</sup> 
                My senior years came, and I am still a slacker.<sup>9</sup> I tried to give a little bit of effort on my assignments.<sup>10</sup> 
                But I still ended up spending more time playing games or hanging out with my classmates.<sup>11</sup> Sometimes, we go to mall or go to cinema to watch movies.<sup>12</sup> Sometimes, I go out on trips with my Family.<sup>13</sup> We would go to beaches to go island hopping and swim at the beaches.<sup>14</sup> We also go to tourist spots on provinces and visit historical places.<sup>15</sup>  
                It was all fun and games, until I saw my classmates worrying about their future.<sup>16</sup> Everyone are thinking about their future and their career path.<sup>17</sup> 
                Everyone was working hard for their future while I spend my time playing games.<sup>18</sup> Then, I started thinking to myself what will happen to me.<sup>19</sup> 
                If I keep on slacking what will happen to my future and my life.<sup>20</sup> So, I tried to change myself for the better.<sup>21</sup> I tried spending less time on playing games and more on studying for my career choice.<sup>22</sup> 
                I know it may sound funny but, I want to work on my future for the reason that if I succeed in my life, I will be able to buy more games and consoles.<sup>23</sup></p>

            <h2 id="college">College Years</h2>
            <br>
            <div class="textbox">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I started college, I had no idea what I was getting myself into.<sup>1</sup>
                I was only 17 years old at that time.<sup>2</sup> which made me feel insignificant because everyone around me appeared to be grown enough to deal with life's difficulties.<sup>3</sup> 
                I was having trouble adjusting to campus because there are so many events and activities to participate in until the epidemic struck.<sup>4</sup> 
                Our school incorporated online programs.<sup>5</sup> which simply added to the difficulty of studying.<sup>6</sup> 
                I couldn't hear what the professor was saying, and my surroundings aren't conducive to learning.<sup>7</sup> 
                So I had to take a break for a year.<sup>8</sup> thinking that we would be able to do face-to-face schooling the next year.<sup>9</sup> 
                We were not allowed to go out while I was on leave from school.<sup>10</sup> 
                As a result, I attempted to learn new hobbies.<sup>11</sup> Reading novels or strumming the guitar, for example.<sup>12</sup> 
                I also attempted to learn game programming.<sup>13</sup>
                Sometime, I worry about my future.<sup>14</sup> And whenever that happens I remind myself of the quote.<sup>15</sup> 
                <blockquote>"If you want to be happy, do not dwell in the past, do no worry about the future, focus on living fully in the present."<sup>16</sup> <dd>- Roy T. Bennett</dd></blockquote></p>
                <p>It lifted my spirits up and made me hopeful about my life.<sup>17</sup> And now I am back to school. <sup>18</sup> 
                I am ready to study and learn for my future career.<sup>19</sup>
                Life may be hard, but I will learn to adapt and grow.<sup>20</sup>
