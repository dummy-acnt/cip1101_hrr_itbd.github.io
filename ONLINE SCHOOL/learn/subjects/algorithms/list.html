                <h1>Lists</h1>
                <p>Lists are one type of data structure, and can store multiple values.They are unique in how they pair data with pointers, the pointers indicating the next piece of data's memory location. In Lists, data is stored in various disjointed
                    locations of memory. Because data is stored in different locations, each piece of data can only be accessed through the pointer that precedes it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers.
                </p>

                <p>Elements in a linked list are known as nodes.</p>
                <p>Each node contains a key and a pointer to its successor node, known as next.</p>
                <p>The attribute named head points to the first element of the linked list.</p>
                <p>The last element of the linked list is known as the tail.</p>
